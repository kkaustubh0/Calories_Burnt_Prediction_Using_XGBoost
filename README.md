# Calories_Burnt_Prediction_Using_XGBoost
In this project, we are using the XGBoost Regressor for predicting the amount of calories burnt during the exercise based on parameters like a person's age, height, weight, duration of exercise, heart rate, body temperature and so on. The dataset has been split into 9:1 and mean absolute error has been used as the evaluation metric.
